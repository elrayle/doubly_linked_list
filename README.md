# LinkedList

Ruby implementation of Doubly Linked List, following some Ruby idioms.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'linked_list'
```

And then execute:

```shell
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
$ gem install linked_list
```

## Usage

```ruby
object = Object.new # could be anything
list = LinkedList::List.new

list.push(object)
list << object # same as `push`

list.unshift(object)

list.pop
list.shift

list.reverse
list.reverse!

list.each      # Enumerator object
list.each { |e| puts e }

list.first     # head of the list
list.last      # tail of the list

list.length
list.size      # same as `length`

list.to_a
```

Another way to instantiate `List` or `Node` is to use conversion functions.
First, include `LinkedList::Conversions` module to your class

```ruby
class Foo
  include LinkedList::Conversions
end
```

Now anywhere in your class you can use the following methods

```ruby
Node(object)           # will return new `Node` object
List(object)           # will return new `List` object with one `Node` object
List([object, object]) # will return new `List` object with two `Node` objects
```

Please see `LinkedList::List`, `LinkedList::Node`, and
`LinkedList::Conversions` for details.
